📊 Agricultural Commodity Price Analysis & Predictive Insights
📌 Project Overview 

This project focuses on analyzing agricultural commodity price data using data analytics and predictive analysis techniques. The goal is to understand price trends, regional variations, commodity performance, and profit margins, and to present insights through an interactive Power BI dashboard.

The project helps farmers, traders, students, and policymakers make data-driven decisions by converting raw agricultural market data into meaningful insights and future price indications.

🎯 Objectives of the Project

Analyze historical agricultural commodity price data.

Identify price trends, seasonal patterns, and regional variations

Compare commodity prices across states, districts, and markets

Calculate key metrics such as average price, modal price, and profit margin

Provide predictive insights for future price behavior

Build an interactive and user-friendly Power BI dashboard

📂 Dataset Description

The dataset includes agricultural market price data with the following fields: 

State

District

Market

Commodity Name

Minimum Price

Maximum Price

Modal Price

Arrival Quantity

Date

The data was collected from official government sources and cleaned for analysis.

🛠️ Tools and Technologies Used

Power BI Desktop – Dashboard creation and data visualization

Power Query – Data cleaning and transformation

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Calculated measures and KPIs

Excel / CSV – Dataset storage and preprocessing

🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA was performed to ensure data quality and reliability:

Handling missing and inconsistent values

Removing duplicate records

Standardizing categorical fields

Validating data types

Creating derived metrics such as averages and profit margins

Identifying and analyzing outliers

This step ensured the dataset was clean and ready for analysis and prediction.

📈 Analysis Performed

Overall average market price analysis

Highest and lowest commodity price analysis

Commodity-wise price distribution

Profit margin comparison by commodity
